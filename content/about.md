I'm a fourth year undergraduate at the University of Alberta, studying mathematics and computing science. I'm joining Jane Street in March 2022. I've previously had internships at Jane Street and LinkedIn. Also, I've done work on interpretabable reinforcement learning under the guidance of Matthew Guzdial, and safe reinforcement learning under the guidance of Michael Bowling.
